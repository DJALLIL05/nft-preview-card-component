## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this project, I learned about box-shadow and how to add shadow to different elements. moreover, I learned about hsl colors (hue, saturation and lightness)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  color: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
  color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
  background-color: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
}
```
